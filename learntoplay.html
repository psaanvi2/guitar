            First you need a guitar.You need to make sure that your guitar 
            is the right size because depending on your age and hight you 
            need that size of a guitar.If you are just starting then I would
             recomend getting a original size of a guitar if you are 12 years or older.
             <br><br>
            Also you would need a guitar pick to help you play the strings.Once you get 
            a bit more sence of how to play then you could also purchase a capo the helps
            you to play songs that have a higher pitch.Also you have to purchase a guitar depending on 
            what hand you write with.

                    The first thing is that you need to know is how to hold a guitar. 
                    It will depend if you are a right handed or left handed guitarist. If you have 
                    a right handed guitar, then you would hold the guitar horizontally, and the neck would go on the 
                    left side and the body would rest on your lap on the other side. The next thing is that you should know the 
                    names of the strings. The thickest one is the low E string then the one after it is the A string
                    then after that it is the D string, after that it is the G string, and then it is the B string, and the 
                    last sting is called the high E string. When you start pressing down on the strings it will hurt your fingers 
                    in the start but then your fingers will get use to it. Also the are boxes on the guitar neck those are called the frets. Those help
                    show what each note sounds like when you press down on them. The closer you go down the neck and press down on the string the hgher the note.
