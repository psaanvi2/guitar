            A guitar normaly has six strings, a fretted fingerboard,
            and a soundbox with a pronounced waist. It probably originated 
            in Spain in the early 16th century. By 1800 it was being strung
            with six single strings; 19th-century innovations gave it its 
            modern form. There are six strings on a acoustic guitar the thickest 
            string is called the low E string. Then the one after that is called
            the A string, and the one after that is called the D string. Then the next one 
            is called G string, and then the next one is the B string. Then the last string 
            is called the high E string.

                    So the first thing to do it hold you guitar sideways on your 
                    lap, and make sure that the neck of the guitar is towards your left hand
                    (for right handed guitar). Then there are multiple boxes on the neck of the guitar those are 
                    called the frets.Each fret show that how high th note is.The first fret is on the very end of the
                    guitar the (the part that most away from you).The last fret is the one that's the most close to you.
