            The three main supplies you would need is a right or light handed guitar
            depending on what had you write with. A guitar pick to help you strum and play the strings.
            Also later on if you need to learn how to play a song that is high piched and you are a 
            beginner then you will need a capo that goes on the frets on the guitar to make the notes
            pich higher.

                If you have small hands ar 12 years or younger then I wouldn't recomend the 
                original size guitar. I would recomend  the Squier Mini Strat is a great choice
                 for a first guitar. Its shorter 22.75” scale (compared to a more standard 25.5”)
                  body and thin, lightweight composition makes it ideal for new guitarists just getting
                   used to the feel of an instrument.
