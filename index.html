             A guitar is a stringed instrument with a flat body,
             a long neck with frets, and usually six 
             strings that are played with the fingers or with a pick.A guitar can be played
             by anyone and they can learn how to play their favourtie songs and tunes.
            I think you should to learn how to play a guitar because it is a very fun experience 
            tring to learn a new skill. Also in the begining of learning to playthe guitar your fingers
            will hurt a bit but it will go away over time and practice.

                   There are many different kinds of guitars, but the most common 
                   are the acoustic guitar, electric guitar, and the bass guitar. I play  
                   the acoustic guitar because I got recomened to use that kind of a guitar when 
                   I started to play. Also the acoustic guitar makes less noise and needs less
                   equiment to start playing it.
